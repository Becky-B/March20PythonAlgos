# 3. You have somebody working for you for 7 days, and have a gold bar for paying him.
#    You must give him 1/7 of the gold bar each day. What are the fewest number of cuts to the bar of gold
#    that will allow you to pay him 1/7th each day, and draw it out! Hint: You can take pieces back and give other
#    pieces to him. It doesn't have to literally be 7 pieces of the gold bar. He just needs to have 
#    x/7th of the gold bar at the end of day x
